Welcome to the PHQ-9 App: Your Partner in Mental Health Screening – Helping You Track and Understand Your Well-Being

What is PHQ-9?

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used, evidence-based screening tool designed to help assess the presence and severity of depression. It consists of 9 simple questions that reflect common symptoms of depression, such as low mood, loss of interest, sleep changes, and fatigue.

The PHQ-9 can be self-administered or completed with the support of a healthcare professional. Because it is short, reliable, and easy to score, it is frequently used in both clinical and community settings to support early detection, track progress over time, and guide treatment planning.

This app provides a quick and private way to complete the PHQ-9 questionnaire. All assessments are self-contained—no login required and no data stored. At the end, you’ll receive an interpretation of your score to better understand your mental health status.


Scoring Threshold

PHQ-9 scores are calculated by adding the responses to all 9 questions. Each question is scored on a scale of 0 to 3:

Not at all = 0

Several days = 1

More than half the days = 2

Nearly every day = 3


The total score (0–27) indicates the severity of depressive symptoms:

Total Score	Depression Severity
1–4	Minimal depression
5–9	Mild depression
10–14	Moderate depression
15–19	Moderately severe depression
20–27	Severe depression


History of PHQ-9
1990s Origins

In the mid-to-late 1990s, researchers at Columbia University, led by Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, Dr. Janet B.W. Williams, and Dr. Kurt Kroenke, collaborated with colleagues to develop the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). This initiative was part of the larger PRIME-MD project (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders), which aimed to provide primary care physicians with a reliable, time-efficient, and patient-friendly tool for diagnosing common mental health disorders, particularly depression.

1999–2001 Development of PHQ-9

Building on the broader PHQ framework, the PHQ-9 was designed as a short, self-administered questionnaire focused specifically on assessing the presence and severity of depression. Published in 1999 in JAMA, the PHQ-9 quickly gained traction because of its strong psychometric properties, ease of use, and direct alignment with the nine diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the DSM-IV. Its scoring allowed clinicians not only to identify depressive symptoms but also to quantify severity levels.

2000s Widespread Adoption

Throughout the 2000s, the PHQ-9 became the most widely used depression screening tool worldwide. Its adoption spread across primary care, psychiatry, research, and community health settings. The questionnaire was validated across different populations, languages, and cultures, establishing it as a gold standard for depression screening in both clinical and non-clinical environments.

2010s Global Recognition

During the 2010s, the PHQ-9 was integrated into national health surveys, electronic medical records, and global mental health programs. Its use expanded to low- and middle-income countries due to its brevity, no-cost availability, and straightforward scoring system. The tool became a cornerstone in public health strategies for early detection of depression, suicide risk monitoring, and treatment evaluation.

2020s Digital Integration

In the 2020s, the PHQ-9 has been widely incorporated into digital health platforms, telemedicine, and mobile apps, enabling patients to self-assess and track their symptoms remotely. Its role has expanded beyond screening to include treatment monitoring, outcome measurement, and population-level mental health surveillance. Today, the PHQ-9 remains one of the most validated, accessible, and globally utilized instruments for depression assessment.


What Does PHQ-9 Help Detect? Key Domains
Key domains: cognitive-affective, somatic, and functional impairment. 
Affective/cognitive domain
This domain includes psychological and emotional symptoms like anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure), depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation. 
Somatic domain
This domain covers physical symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, and psychomotor changes (being slowed down or restless). 
Functional impairment domain
The PHQ-9 also includes a non-scored question about how these symptoms affect daily functioning, such as work, chores, and relationships with others.


Clinical Impact 
For diagnosis and screening
Effective screening in primary care: The PHQ-9 was designed for use in primary care settings, where depression is common but often goes unrecognized. A positive screen (score ≥ 10) on the PHQ-9 can prompt a provider to conduct a more thorough diagnostic interview.
Aids in diagnosis: The PHQ-9 is directly based on the nine diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode from the DSM-5. This means clinicians can use a patient's responses to make a provisional diagnosis, which can be confirmed by a more in-depth mental health evaluation.
Efficient and low-burden: Because it is a brief, self-report questionnaire, the PHQ-9 can be completed in minutes by a patient and quickly scored by a clinician. This is a significant advantage over more lengthy diagnostic interviews and can be easily incorporated into a busy clinical workflow. 
For severity measurement and monitoring
Quantifies symptom severity: PHQ-9 scores correspond to depression severity, with specific ranges indicating minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression. This numerical output provides a concrete, objective measure of a patient's condition.
Monitors treatment response: Since it is designed for repeat administration, the PHQ-9 is valuable for tracking changes in a patient's depressive symptoms over time. Clinicians can use it to determine if treatment is working, helping to inform decisions about whether to adjust counseling, pharmacotherapy, or other interventions.
Guides treatment planning: The severity score helps guide treatment decisions. For example, a higher score may suggest the need for more intensive treatment, such as pharmacotherapy or referral to a mental health specialist. 
For risk assessment
Screens for suicidal ideation: One of the nine items on the PHQ-9 specifically asks about suicidal thoughts. A "yes" response to this question serves as an important red flag, prompting further immediate assessment of suicide risk by a qualified professional. 
For population health and research
Standardized outcomes data: The widespread use and consistent scoring of the PHQ-9 generate standardized data that can be used for research, quality improvement initiatives, and tracking population mental health trends.
Cross-cultural adaptability: Validated in dozens of languages, the PHQ-9 can be used to compare depression outcomes across diverse populations, making it valuable for global mental health research. 

PHQ-9 feasibility
-Time-efficient and easy to use: As a brief, self-administered, nine-item questionnaire, the PHQ-9 takes only a few minutes for a patient to complete and for a clinician to score. This makes it highly practical for integration into busy settings like primary care clinics and general hospitals, placing minimal burden on both patients and staff.

-Widespread availability and accessibility: The PHQ-9 is in the public domain and is available for free, eliminating financial barriers to its use. It has been validated in numerous languages, expanding its accessibility for diverse populations and helping to address health disparities.

-Flexible administration: The PHQ-9 can be administered in various formats, including on paper, over the phone, or via electronic devices such as tablets. This flexibility allows it to be easily adapted to a variety of healthcare settings and patient needs.

PHQ-9 research value

-Standardized outcomes measurement: Its widespread use and consistent scoring methods produce standardized data that is essential for research on depression. The PHQ-9 is a crucial tool for tracking depression prevalence, monitoring population mental health trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in both clinical trials and observational studies.

-Strong psychometric properties: Extensive research has confirmed the PHQ-9's robust psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (alpha coefficients often > 0.8) and good test-retest reliability. It shows strong convergent validity with other measures of depression and constructs like functional impairment, reinforcing its use as a reliable outcome measure.

-Adaptable to diverse populations: The tool has been validated across different patient groups and cultural contexts, including adolescents, psychiatric patients, and individuals with chronic medical conditions. This adaptability makes it a valuable instrument for cross-cultural research and for studying specific subgroups affected by depression
